# Fizz Buzz In Shakespeare Programming Language

This project contains code for running FizzBuzz in the [Shakespeare Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Programming_Language),
also known as SPL. SPL is an [esoteric programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), 
and as such, is not intended to be used as a serious programming language.

This GitHub repo contains code that is featured on my blog post,
["The Theater Student's Guide To Passing Coding Interviews"](https://henrydangprg.com/2020/09/08/the-theater-students-guide-to-passing-coding-interviews/).

To run the code, you can find any of the compilers online, or use an SPL to C code translater.

If you are interested in learning more about SPL, I encourage you to check out this 
[research paper by Karl Hasselström and Jon Åslund](http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare.pdf) 
on how the language works.
